<h1>Dynamical Systems</h1>

I developed an upper-level dynamical systems course for <a href="https://www.bard.edu/" target="_blank">Bard College</a> which I taught on five occasions.  This page contains information about this course.

<h2>Summary</h2>
The course focused on discrete-time dynamical systems, fractal geometry, and complex dynamics.  The preqrequisite was Bard's Linear Algebra with Ordinary Differential Equations course, and the audience for the course was a mix of sophomores, juniors, and seniors majoring in mathematics, physics, computer science, and economics.  The course took a very computational and experimental approach to the subject, and students spent much of their time exploring dynamical systems in <i>Mathematica</i>.

<p>The textbook for the course was <i>Chaos: An Introduction to Dynamical Systems</i>, by Alligoood, Sauer, and Yorke.</p>

<h2>Homework Assignments</h2>
Here are the weekly homework assignments for the course, which were worth 50% of the course grade. These assignments are a mixture of problem-solving, formal proofs, and computer analysis. Students were encouraged to work together on the homework but were required to write up their own solutions individually in LaTeX or <i>Mathematica</i>.
<ul>
<li><a href="Homework1.htm" target="_blank">Homework 1</a> (Iteration, Orbits, Attracting Cycles)
<li><a href="Homework2.htm" target="_blank">Homework 2</a> (The Logistic Family)
<li><a href="Homework3.htm" target="_blank">Homework 3</a> (The Tent Map, Itineraries)
<li><a href="Homework4.htm" target="_blank">Homework 4</a> (Two-Dimensional Maps, Strange Attractors, Double Pendulum)
<li><a href="Homework5.htm" target="_blank">Homework 5</a> (Stability of Fixed Points in Two Dimensions, Stable and Unstable Manifolds)
<li><a href="Homework6.htm" target="_blank">Homework 6</a> (Topological Conjugacy)
<li><a href="Homework7.htm" target="_blank">Homework 7</a> (Transition Graphs, Tree Maps, Torus Maps)
<li><a href="Homework8.htm" target="_blank">Homework 8</a> (Self-Similar Curves)
<li><a href="Homework9.htm" target="_blank">Homework 9</a> (Space-Filling Curves)
<li><a href="Homework10.htm" target="_blank">Homework 10</a> (Iterated Function Systems, Box-Counting Dimension)
</ul>


<h2>Takehome Exams</h2>
There were two takehome exams for the course.  The takehome midterm was worth 20% of the grade, and the takehome final was worth 15%.
<ul>
<li><a href="Midterm.htm" target="_blank">Takehome Midterm</a>
<li><a href="Final.htm" target="_blank">Takehome Final</a>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
Though the course used a textbook, I supplemented this with notes on complex dynamics, including Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://e.math.cornell.edu/people/belk/dynamicalsystems/NotesComplexDynamics.pdf">Notes &ndash; Complex Dynamics</a></li>
<li><a href="https://e.math.cornell.edu/people/belk/dynamicalsystems/NotesJuliaMandelbrot.pdf">Notes &ndash; Julia Sets and the Mandelbrot Set</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Syllabus</h1>

Here is the syllabus from the last time I taught the course.

<a name="textbook"></a><h2><img class="a" style="max-width: 30%" src="ChaosBook.png"/>Textbook Information</h2>
The textbook is <i>Chaos: An Introduction to Dynamical Systems</i>, by Alligoood, Sauer, and Yorke.  You will need a copy of the textbook for reading and homework problems, though you do not need to bring it to class.  The book is currently available for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Introduction-Dynamical-Textbooks-Mathematical/dp/0387946772">$62 from Amazon.com</a>.  You can also buy a <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387946771">PDF of the textbook</a> from the publisher for&nbsp;$50.

<a name="description"></a><h2>Course Description</h2>
A dynamical system is any system whose state changes according to some fixed rule.  The concept includes both continuous systems governed by differential equations and discrete-time systems described by an iterated function.  This course will focus on dynamical systems that exhibit chaotic behavior.  We will explore the source of chaos in discrete and continuous systems, as well as the transition to chaos in systems whose behavior depends on an external parameter.  Topics to be covered include one-dimensional maps, discrete and continuous dynamics in multiple dimensions, chaotic attractors, fractals, and fractal dimension.  We will end with an introduction to complex dynamics, including an exploration of Julia sets and and the Mandelbrot set.
</p>
<p>
The prerequisite is Math&nbsp;213 (Linear Algebra with ODE's) or the equivalent.  The course will also assume some familiarity with computer programming, and many of the homework assignments will involve simple programming in <i>Mathematica</i>.

<a name="policies"></a><h2>Homework, Exams, and&nbsp;Grading</h2>

<p><h4>Homework</h4>
Homework assignments will be a mixture of problem-solving, formal proofs, and computer analysis. You are encouraged to work together on the homework, especially if you don't have prior experience with using computers in math courses. However, you should write up your own solutions individually, and you must acknowledge any collaborators.
</p>
<p>All homework assignments must be written in LaTeX or <i>Mathematica</i> and submitted to me by e-mail.</p>

<p><h4>Final Project</h4>
There will be a final project, on a topic of your choice. I am happy to allow group projects, though each member of a group must contribute as much effort as a student working individually. A typical project for a pair of students might consist of a 10 minute class presentation, a significant <i>Mathematica</i> notebook, and a 2&ndash;4 page written report. More details on the final project will be given as we approach the end of the semester.

<p><h4>Exams and Grading</h4>
The grade will be based on the weekly homework, the takehome midterm exam, the takehome final exam, and the final project:</p>

<table class="grid">
<tr><td class="box">Homework</td> <td class="box">50%</td></tr>

<tr><td class="box">Final Exam</td>     <td class="box">15%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="box">Final Project</td> <td class="box">15%</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<h2>Project Information</h2>
Part of the requirements for this class include a final project.  Here is some basic information about the project:
<ul>
<li>&bull; Though individual projects are allowed, I would prefer for you to work together in groups of two or three.</li>
<li>&bull; The project must involve a short in-class computer presentation, of the following length:
    <ul>
    <li>&bull; Individual Project: 4&ndash;5 minute presentation</li>
    <li>&bull; Two-Person Project: 8&ndash;10 minute presentation</li>
    <li>&bull; Three-Person Project: 12&ndash;15 minute presentation</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
<li>&bull; The project must also involve:
    <ul>
    <li>&bull; A <i>Mathematica</i> notebook, roughly as long and complicated as the solution to a homework assignment, <b><u>and</b></u></li>
    <li>&bull; A short typed paper, describing how your notebook works and the mathematics behind it.
    </ul>
    The expectations for these vary according to the size of a group.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Project Topics</h4>
In general, good topics include:
<ul>
<li>&bull; An implementation of any one application of dynamical systems.  For example, you could implement something that you find in any one journal article you find that uses dynamical systems or fractals.</li>
<li>&bull; Any <i>Mathematica</i> notebook that incorporates real-world data.</li>
<li>&bull; Any exploration of a dynamical systems of fractal geometry topic not covered in the course.
